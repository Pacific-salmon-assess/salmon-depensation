# salmon-depensation
Repository for examining the evidence for depensation among Pacific salmon stocks.
Various parameterizations of spawner-recruit models are explained and visualized [here](https://pacific-salmon-assess.github.io/salmon-depensation/code/parameterizations.html), and we fit a simple depensatory model then visualize the depensation parameter [here](https://pacific-salmon-assess.github.io/salmon-depensation/code/frequentist_depensatory_mods.html).
